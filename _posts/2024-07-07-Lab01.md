##  _Lab 1-1_

### 📝 Summary
In this lab, we analyze `Lab01-01.exe` and `Lab01-01.dll` using static analysis techniques.  
Our goal is to identify suspicious characteristics, determine the purpose of the files, and extract any host-based or network-based indicators.  
We use tools such as **PE Studio**, **PEiD**, **PEview**, **Strings**, **Dependency Walker**, **Detect It Easy**, and **VirusTotal**.

##  _Lab 3-3_
### üìù Summary

The malware `Lab03-03.exe` is a dropper that uses a common stealth technique known as **process hollowing** (or process replacement). It works by launching a legitimate Windows process, `svchost.exe`, in a suspended state. It then overwrites the memory of this new process with its own malicious code before finally resuming its execution.

This allows the malware's core logic, including its **network communication**, to run under the guise of a **trusted system process**, making it significantly harder to detect.

### üìç Question 1: Process Behavior
#### üüß Lab03-03.exe

> **What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process Explorer?**
{: .prompt-tip }
When you run `Lab03-03.exe`, its behavior is a classic giveaway:


![q1](../assets/img/PMA-Labs/lab03/lab3-3.exe.png)
*Process Explorer*

- It appears in **Process Explorer** for only a brief moment before terminating.
- It immediately spawns a new instance of `svchost.exe` as a child process.
- The parent process, `Lab03-03.exe`, then exits, leaving the `svchost.exe` process running without a parent.

> This "launch-and-terminate" behavior is **highly suspicious**. It's a textbook indicator of a process injector, whose sole purpose is to load malware into another process and then disappear.

### üìç Question 2: Memory Modification
#### üüß Lab03-03.exe

> **Can you identify any live memory modifications?**
{: .prompt-tip }
Yes, live memory modifications are clearly visible. The `svchost.exe` process created by the malware is a hollowed-out version of the legitimate system process.

*Process Explorer*

You can confirm this using **Process Explorer**:
1.  Right-click the suspicious `svchost.exe` process and select **Properties**.
2.  Navigate to the **Strings** tab.

You will find strings that do **not** belong in a legitimate `svchost.exe` instance, such as:

- `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
- `\svchost.exe`

> These strings are definitive proof that the memory of `svchost.exe` was overwritten with malicious code.

### üìç Question 3: Host-Based Indicators
#### üüß Lab03-03.exe

> **What are the malware‚Äôs host-based indicators?**
{: .prompt-tip }

*Screen shot*
- The malware creates the log file practicalmalwareanalysis.log.

### üìç Question 4:
#### üüß Lab03-03.exe
> **What is the malware's purpose?**
{: .prompt-tip}

By typing in an application like WordPad and then examining the file `practicalmalwareanalysis.log`, we can see that the malware has logged all of our keystrokes.

The program's primary purpose is to function as a **stealthy keylogger**. A keylogger's goal is to **steal sensitive information** like usernames, passwords, and financial details by secretly recording everything a user types.

The malware achieves this by injecting its keylogging payload into the `svchost.exe` process, effectively hiding its malicious activity within a trusted system process.

##  _Lab 3-4_

### üìù Summary  

**Lab03-04.exe** is a multi-stage dropper/backdoor that uses a simple **anti-analysis check**.  
It searches for a specific file (`C:\WINDOWS\system32\wuamgrd.exe`) and **exits silently** if the file is not present.  

On a clean sandbox the process appears to start and then terminates within milliseconds, leaving **no files, no registry changes, and no network activity**. The sample only proceeds to its backdoor behavior when its environmental check is satisfied.

### üìç Question 1: Initial Behavior  
#### üü© Lab03-04.exe  

> **What happens when you run this file?**  
{: .prompt-tip}

![q3](../assets/img/PMA-Labs/lab03/lab3-4-1.exe.png)
*ProcMon*
*(ProcMon shows the full command-line used to delete the original binary, redirected to NUL.)*

When executed in a clean analysis VM or sandbox:

- The process launches and then **immediately terminates** (appears for a fraction of a second).
- No files are written, no registry keys are modified.

> This silent exit indicates an **early environment check** designed to hide malicious behavior in automated environments.

### üìç Question 2: The Roadblock  
#### üü© Lab03-04.exe  

> **What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?**  
{: .prompt-tip}

![q2](../assets/img/PMA-Labs/lab03/lab3-4-1.exe.png)
*PEStudio*

Among the strings, we find:  
- A domain name reference  
- The registry path `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\XPS`  
- Keywords such as `DOWNLOAD`, `UPLOAD`  
- The presence of `HTTP/1.0`

These indicators strongly suggest the sample functions as an **HTTP-based backdoor**. It is likely capable of **communicating with a remote server**, performing file transfers, and maintaining persistence through registry modifications.  

---

### üìç Question 3: Bypassing the Roadblock  
#### üü© Lab03-04.exe  

> **Are there other ways to run this program?**  
{: .prompt-tip}

We attempted to exercise alternate code paths by supplying candidate arguments derived from the program strings (for example: `cc`, `re`, `in`). Despite these attempts the sample still spawns `cmd.exe` to issue a delete command and the file is removed during execution.  

At this stage the binary consistently self-cleans and returns no additional observable behavior, so further dynamic exploration is limited. This avenue will be revisited in **Lab 9**, where we'll apply more advanced techniques (memory dumping, debugger-assisted tracing, and controlled network responses) to recover the secondary payload and trigger hidden functionality.

## Phishing mail analysis

_EML File_


## Summary
![meta data](../assets/img/phishing/introduction.png)
_summary_
The email pretends to be from a legitimate source and includes an attachment that, at first glance, appears to be a harmless file (in this case, disguised as a `.wav` file). However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that the attachment is actually an `.html` file containing hidden scripts that can execute malicious code once opened in a browser.


## Technical analysis
### 1-legitimate traffic:
![mail header](../assets/img/phishing/mail%20struc.png)
_mail header_
 attackers often take advantage of legitimate email processing systems to make their phishing attempts seem more authentic. For instance, when they use the loopback address `127.0.0.1`, it can make it look like the email is coming from within the organization itself. Plus, by employing `DKIM` signatures, they can further legitimize their emails. This clever tactic can really help them slip past security controls, especially if the system isnâ€™t properly configured. It makes detecting these phishing emails much more challenging.

### 2-Mail Connection:

report details from `AbuseIPDB`:The analysis of `http://secforces.com/` involved a fake login page for American Express, indicating the intent was to harvest user credentials.

![virusTotal](../assets/img/phishing/virusTotal.png)
_virusTotal_
report details from `virusTotal`: The analysis of `http://secforces.com/` indicates that it is associated with malicious activity, particularly phishing. 

### 3-Malicious Attachment 
![obfuscate](../assets/img/phishing/obfuscate.png)
_obfuscate_
The file is named with a `.wav.html` extension, which is designed to confuse the recipient into thinking it's an audio file, but it's actually an HTML file. This is a common trick used to bypass email security filters by disguising the file type.

### 4-Payload
![payload](../assets/img/phishing/payload.png)
_payload_
The attached `.html` file contains obfuscated ```JavaScript``` within HTML tags. This script is designed to run automatically when the file is opened.


## how to detect??

1. Mail Gateway Security
2. Endpoint Protection
3. Threat Intelligence Integration
4. Implement Advanced Email Filtering
5. Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
6. Monitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

By employing a combination of technical controls, user education, and proactive threat monitoring
